Best practices:
---

* Use a dash in a component name (my-footer instead of footer) so you don't accidentally clash with existing html tags.

* Create a folder for each component, because every component is like its own mini application. Create everything at the lowest possible level, because that minimizes the complexity of the application. If you need it somewhere else, move it higher up.
